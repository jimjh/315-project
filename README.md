How does the population distribution compare over time, from 2000 to 2010,
particularly by race?

1.  Stack bar plot to show proportion for each county/tract
2.  Map with contour plots
3. 	Chloropleth map - Toggle between different races
4.  Graphing percentage change in population

How do characteristics like age and income correlate to population distribution and race in 2010?

5.  Age-Pop: Chloropleth with pop density and income as contour
6.  Income-Pop: Chloropleth with pop density and income as contour
7.  Age-Race: Violin-plots/boxplot/overlapping histogram
8.  Income-Race: Violin-plots/boxplot/overlapping histogram
